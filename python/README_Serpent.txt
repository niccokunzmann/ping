Serpent serialization library (Python/.NET/Java)
------------------------------------------------
Serpent provides ast.literal_eval() compatible object tree serialization.
It serializes an object tree into bytes (utf-8 encoded string) that can be decoded and then
passed as-is to ast.literal_eval() to rebuild it as the original object tree.
As such it is safe to send serpent data to other machines over the network for instance
(because only 'safe' literals are encoded).
