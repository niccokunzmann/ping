PYRO - Python Remote Objects


Pyro enables you to build applications in which objects can talk
to each other over the network, with minimal programming effort.
You can just use normal Python method calls to call objects on
other machines. Pyro is written in 100% pure Python and so it
runs on many platforms and Python versions, including Python 3.x.
